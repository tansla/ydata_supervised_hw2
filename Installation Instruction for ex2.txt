Installation Instruction for ex2 - 
working on a local python environment

Below you can find how to make the exercise working on your laptop/pc, with virtual machine and VSCode as editor. You can use or do not use virtual machine, the same for VScode.

1. Download python - https://www.python.org/downloads/ - pay attention to add python to the environment variables (check box in the installation).

2. Download VScode (for edit python files).

3. Create a folder to the exercise and put there the exercise python file downloaded from the classroom.

4. Open terminal and go to the exercise folder location
create a virtual machine: python -m venv ./
python3 -m venv tutorial-env

5. Activate your environment. In windows you should enter: Scripts\activate.bat. 
Then the virtual environment name shold be in parentheses before the folder name in the terminal.
source tutorial-env/bin/activate

6. Open VScode then open the exercise folder. VScode should suggest you to download python extension, otherwise, download it using the extension tab.
Please make sure that python interpreter is the virtual environment you created (button right in VScode).

7. In the left side of VScode you should see your folder content. Run “regression_&_regularization_exercise.py” (it wil ask you to add a configuration and accept it).

8. Please install also some basic libraries. Go back to the command line (pay attention that you are in the virtual machine) and enter
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
